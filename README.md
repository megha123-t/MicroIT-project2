Here's an overview of the Calculator project:

Project Title: Calculator

Description: A basic application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key Features:

1. User-friendly interface (GUI or CLI)
2. Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, /)
3. Real-time calculation and display of results
4. Input validation (handling errors, invalid inputs)

Possible Technical Requirements:

1. Programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++)
2. GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter, React) or CLI implementation
3. Basic mathematical operations implementation

Potential Enhancements:

1. Advanced mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometry, exponentiation)
2. Memory functions (e.g., save, recall)
3. History of calculations
4. Customizable interface or themes
